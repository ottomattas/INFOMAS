# Genius Tournaments Ran for Analysis
Overall, agent 1 = opponent; agent 2 = win.win.
Also, whenever there was a session in a tournament which included the same preference profile for both agents, the results of that specific session were pruned.

## Assignment A
Tournaments were ran on five domains, with preference profiles flipped every 20 sessions:
- FiftyFifty2013_domain
- Domain8
- Ultimatum
- Animal
- Travel-A-domain

## Assignment B
Tournaments were ran on five domains, with all available Acceptance Strategies in Genius against our Acceptance Strategy:
- FiftyFifty2013_domain
- Domain8
- Ultimatum
- Animal
- Travel-A-domain

## Assignment C
Tournaments were ran on five domains, with all available Opponent Models in Genius against our Opponent Model:
- FiftyFifty2013_domain
- Domain8
- Ultimatum
- Animal
- Travel-A-domain

## Assignment D
All sessions include at least one agent with preference uncertainty. The tournament was ran on the party domain.

## Assignment E
This is the most extensive tournament setup as we will use it for our baseline performance measurement.
After analysis, we use this data to improve our agent and discuss generality of our agent.

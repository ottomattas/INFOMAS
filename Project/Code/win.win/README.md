Instructions to run the agent:

(1) Add the win.win BOA components if they are not yet available in BOA components. Add all components which can be found in the /bin folder.
(2) Create the BOA win.win party. In BOA parties, create a new party and add all the win.win components which you just added to BOA components.

Now the win.win agent is ready to be used in negotations/tournaments.
